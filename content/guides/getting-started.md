# Getting Started

This guide walks through the complete self-serve setup — from creating your account to having a live citizen-facing portal ready to receive requests.

## Base URL

All API requests are made to:

```
https://portalu-production.up.railway.app
```

---

## Step 1 — Create your org

A single sign-up call creates both your user account and your organization.

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/sign-up
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "org_name": "City of Springfield",
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane@springfield.gov",
  "password": "s3cur3pass!"
}
```

Check your email and verify your account:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/verify-email
Content-Type: application/json

{ "token": "<token from email>" }
```

Then sign in to get your access token:

```http
POST /api/v1/auth/sign-in
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "email": "jane@springfield.gov",
  "password": "s3cur3pass!"
}
```

The response includes `access_token` — include it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in all subsequent requests.

{% callout type="tip" title="Token Refresh" %}
Access tokens expire. Use `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` with your `refresh_token` to get a new one.
{% /callout %}

### Optional — set a custom org slug

The org slug appears in every citizen-facing URL (`/citizen/{org_slug}/...`). You can customize it:

```http
PATCH /api/v1/org
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "City of Springfield",
  "slug": "springfield"
}
```

Org slugs are globally unique — you'll get a `409 Conflict` if it's already taken.

---

## Step 2 — Create a portal

A portal is the citizen-facing surface where users sign up and submit requests. You can have multiple portals per org.

```http
POST /api/v1/org/portals
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Permits & Licenses",
  "slug": "permits",
  "description": "Apply for building permits and business licenses.",
  "domain": "permits.springfield.gov"
}
```

The `slug` is optional — auto-generated from `name` if omitted. Portal slugs are unique within your org.

Once created, citizens can discover the portal at:

```http
GET /api/v1/citizen/springfield/permits
```

This endpoint is public (no auth required) and returns the portal's name, slug, and description — useful for building a landing page before the citizen signs up.

---

## Step 3 — Define request types

Request types are the services your portal offers. Each has a name, optional description, and custom fields.

```http
POST /api/v1/org/portals/{portal_id}/request-types
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Building Permit",
  "description": "Request a permit for construction or renovation."
}
```

Add fields to capture information from citizens:

```http
POST /api/v1/org/portals/{portal_id}/request-types/{rt_id}/fields
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "label": "Project Description",
  "field_type": "textarea",
  "required": true,
  "order": 0
}
```

Supported field types: `text`, `textarea`, `number`, `date`, `select`.

### Optional — set up a workflow

If requests need review steps, define a workflow:

```http
PUT /api/v1/org/portals/{portal_id}/request-types/{rt_id}/workflow
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "key": "initial_review",
      "name": "Initial Review",
      "assignee_role": "reviewer",
      "deadline_offset_hours": 48
    },
    {
      "key": "final_approval",
      "name": "Final Approval",
      "assignee_role": "approver",
      "depends_on": ["initial_review"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tasks activate in dependency order and can be assigned to a role or a specific user.

---

## Step 4 — Go live

With the portal and request types in place, your citizen-facing app can:

1. **Show a landing page** — `GET /citizen/{org_slug}/{portal_slug}` (public, no auth)
2. **Let citizens sign up** — `POST /citizen/{org_slug}/{portal_slug}/auth/sign-up`
3. **List available services** — `GET /citizen/{org_slug}/{portal_slug}/request-types`
4. **Accept submissions** — `POST /citizen/{org_slug}/{portal_slug}/requests`

Citizens track their submissions via `GET /citizen/{org_slug}/{portal_slug}/requests`.

---

## What's next

- Invite team members via `POST /org/invitations` and assign them to portals
- Configure lockout and MFA policies via `PATCH /org/settings`
- Monitor and process requests via `GET /org/portals/{portal_id}/requests`
